The detector coorindate frame
=============================
The origin of a detectors coordinate frame is located in the first pixel of
in the data stream of the detector.

       :align: center

       The red pixel denotes the origin of the coordinate frame of this 
       area detector.

The situation is simple for a point detector (0 dimensional) which has only one
pixel which is also the center of its local coordinate frame. 

After defining the origin of the detector frame also the other axes have to be
defined.

       The axes directions of the detector coordinate frame follow the same 
       rules as the global coordinate frame. The z-axis is determined by the 
       direction of the primary beam.
